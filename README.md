## Developing

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building / Deploying

```bash
npm run build
npm run gh-pages

There's currently a base url issue that requires manually changing hrefs in the generated HTML before deploying.

See [this issue](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/595).
