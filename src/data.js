      I have an ongoing love affair with science and artistic communication, yet I’m pragmatic and an engineer at heart.
      I love the craft of storytelling, which makes me sensitive to user experience and fuels my passion for video game development.
      I’m fascinated by the web and it’s transformative power for society.
      I’m a tactile learner, so I often need to play with concepts before understanding them;
      however, I have been told that learning agility is one of my strengths,
      so it doesn’t take me long to pick up a new concept after getting my hands dirty.
      I like the mantra that one should make their work “as simple as possible, but no simpler”,
      which makes programming for me a continual joy and challenge.
